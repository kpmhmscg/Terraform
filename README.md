Thanks for the quick response. We have a new requirement where we're asked to redesign the access control. The current broad-read access role allows the data owner to view data unrestricted. So the goal here is to ensure minimum privilege and only allow data owner to view data that they own. We wanted create roles with specific data concepts and have them mapped to access central.
