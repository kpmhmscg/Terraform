Hi Rob, I connected with Ken to discuss our access control use case. He has provided us with great information.  Based on the discussion, I wanted to cross-check with you to make sure we're on the same page.
This entitlement repo shared here wouldn't directly apply to our use case. This allows cross-account access and would require a separate AWS account for individual data owners to access the data.
We will need to create the roles in the AWS and have them map in the access central.
